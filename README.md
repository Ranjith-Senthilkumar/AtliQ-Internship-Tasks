# Data Normalization and Cleaning with Pandas

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates **data normalization** and **data cleaning** using **Pandas**. The goal is to take a denormalized dataset and transform it into a normalized form for better analysis.

## Overview

In this project, we will:
- **Normalize** a denormalized dataset into multiple related tables.[Denormalized file - https://github.com/Ranjith-Senthilkumar/AtliQ-Internship-week1/blob/main/Normalization%20-%20Pandas]
- Perform **data cleaning** tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and dealing with duplicates.[ Cleaned Data - https://github.com/Ranjith-Senthilkumar/AtliQ-Internship-week1/blob/main/Pandas%20data%20cleaning]
- Normalized csv file - [https://github.com/Ranjith-Senthilkumar/AtliQ-Internship-week1/blob/main/dim_customers.csv]
